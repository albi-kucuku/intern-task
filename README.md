# PokeAPI project with nextjs + typescript + tailwind

## What's inside
The project consists of 2 pages. The main page, and a page for a pokemon's detail page.
The main page has a limit of 30 pokemons, displaying an image, name, and their pokemon types.
Also there is a search bar that updates live when you start typing in it, and displays the searched pokemon.
The pokemons are grouped in PokemonCards, making it reusable for every pokemon displayed.
Inside the pokemon details page, there are some pokemon stats, e.g. health, type, height, weight etc.
Below that for each pokemon there is an evolution chain.
